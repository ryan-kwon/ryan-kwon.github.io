                If I complete three projects, I can die happy.<br>
                1. Universe Simulator: I want to create a universe simulator like no other.
                There are games that exist that let you interact with the solar system or the known universe,
                however, my creation is different.The simulator will start from the atom and work its way up.
                This idea stemmed from one of the conversations that I had with a friend about space.
                I wonder if the universe reset, would that universe look the same as it is now?
                Will humans look different? Will Earth be the same?
                This simulation will be able to answer a lot of hypothetical questions in a visual manner.
                Yes, you will have the option to create your own universe like other games,
                but the main point of this project is to predict space by manipulating time.
                Since time travel is not possible, yet, this is a solid substitute.
                <br><br>
                2. Full Immersion Virtual Reality: Virtual reality is a new medium for video games,
                but it is not widespread yet. Another thing with VR is that you are not able to touch,
                smell, nor taste. This can be achieved in one of two ways.
                Both require a connection to the brain, but the question is how it will be conducted.
                One option is to have a device implanted directly into the brain to stimulate the nerves.
                I understand that Elon Musk is working on similar technology with his company Neuralink.
                This technology could have practical applications, not just for video games.
                Environments, where a person can be physically harmed, can be replaced with this technology.
                The other option is having a helmet that transmits waves instead of a direct connection.
                I am not sure of its harmful potential in nature.
                I doubt it would be a big problem because we are already living in a world full of waves
                (but then again, those waves are not directly targeting the brain).
                I need to research more about the physics of waves.
                So far what I am sure of is that waves operate in a spectrum,
                a range measured in frequency and length.
                <br><br>
                3. Record Dreams: I realized that I often forget about dreams just ten minutes after waking up.
                There is technology, being researched in Japan,
                that is already being developed by using AI to draw whatever image a person is thinking of.
                However, it is in its early stage and the image can only be done in black and white.
                This technology could change the environment of artists.
                If this existed for mass media,
                a person could just think of what they want instead of hiring a person to draw.

                        The big issue with becoming an Artificial Intelligence developer is 
                        that I have to be mindful of when developing AI is the question of job replacement. 
                        Technology can get to a point where the line between human advancement 
                        and the wellness of the current climate can get really blurry, depending on perspective.
