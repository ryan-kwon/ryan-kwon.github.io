    Description:
        Create a web app using any language which logs calculations
        as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.

        Results should remain between sessions.
        Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest.
        The calculator only needs to implement basic arithmetic operations,
        although you can add other math functions if you would like to impress.
        But don't forget to meet the basic requirements of the exercise first!
    Example:
        user A and user B go to your app at the same time.
        User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10".
        This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”.
        User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it.
        Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".
        This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation.
        User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.

                <p>
                    This started from an email from Sezzle,
                    a company that I applied to for web development internship.
                    Attached was a problem that stated, "Create a web app using
                    any language which logs calculations as they happen and
                    shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.
                    Results should remain between sessions.
                    Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest."
                    Well, easy enough.
                    Let's just start with a simple input of two integers and add them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="CodePara">
                    function() {<br>
                    var x = document.getElementById(first input);<br>
                    var y = document.getElementById(second input);<br>
                    var result = first input + second input;<br>
                    text display = result;<br>
                    }
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, set the function to a button.
                    This should get you the display on the left.
                    What stumps me is the two users at once part,
                    as I realized I might need more backend knowledge
                    Turns out I could use a Github local server. haha.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This inspired me to try to make a legit calculator,
                    where you could input, "3+6-2*4," and get 1.
                    First I started thinking about looking for a '+'
                    to then add the elements of a position before and after the plus
