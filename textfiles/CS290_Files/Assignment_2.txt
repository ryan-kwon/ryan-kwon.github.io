What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.
How did you solve those problems?
The main issue I have is the clashing of display flex and width. So far my solution is to not use a width change and use a padding or margin change. So far it works great

What did you learn from the assignment?
Were there any special insights you had?
What did you find that you already knew?
Positioning elements is something that I had, and still have, a lot of difficulty width. The style display:flex; helps so much with how I understand the way positioning works on elements.

What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?
Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs?
How did you use each of these resources?
I still always refer to w3schools as a basis for understanding how each element change works. It's a great website for foundational skills

What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
When I had the issue with the display:flex and width, I had to google how they work.
