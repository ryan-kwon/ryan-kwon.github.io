-What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
I always had issues with the editing of elements clashing with each other.
An example of this is with the image of myself.
I had a set width in px.
I was trying to add a curved border on it, but it was not applying.
When inspecting the image, it would show a padding effect.
I realized that the image size and the width I set don't not match up well and removed the width.
-What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
I already knew the basic layout of a webpage and how to stylize them to make the viewing experience better.
The html, scss, and javascript tags at the top represent the tools I used to create the webpage.
-What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
I always use w3schools a lot as a reference point.
I think it is a great website for getting the basics of frontend design.
