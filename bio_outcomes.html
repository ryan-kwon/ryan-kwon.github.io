    Science connections:    I am very interested in artificial intelligence.
                            There is often a talk about ethics and how much of a development of AI
                            will it reach to the point of where they are almost indistinguishable to people.
                            I want to read more into that. 
    Biology concepts:       like a biology book for children, i could have descriptions that point to
                            drawings of different structures. Structures can be anything like skeletal structures
    Biology connections:    I would like to look into diet and exercise (how it works?)
                            so that even I could use the information
    Human concepts:         Cognition and learning. That is a really important concept with AI because
                            it would be a dream for computers to be able to mimic the way humans learn and make connections.
                            Learning how humans learn could give insight into how to create good AI.

                This objective is science skills and it is about discovering the natural world. My first sample of work is a bucket list of science-related experiences that I want to have within my lifetime. It shows my mastery of this objective because it sets goals with an understanding of science inherently leading to discovery and ways I could achieve those goals. My second sample of work is my notes from 1A Discovery and Cells. This shows my mastery because notes show the process of formulating an understanding of a topic and can be used again.

                <li>Universe Simulator: I want to create a universe simulator like no other. There are games that exist that let you interact with the solar system or the known universe, however, my creation is different.The simulator will start from the atom and work its way up. This idea stemmed from one of the conversations that I had with a friend about space. I wonder if the universe reset, would that universe look the same as it is now? Will humans look different? Will Earth be the same? This simulation will be able to answer a lot of hypothetical questions in a visual manner. Yes, you will have the option to create your own universe like other games, but the main point of this project is to predict space by manipulating time. Since time travel is not possible, yet, this is a solid substitute.</li>
                <li>Full Immersion Virtual Reality: Virtual reality is a new medium for video games, but it is not widespread yet. Another thing with VR is that you are not able to touch, smell, nor taste. This can be achieved in one of two ways. Both require a connection to the brain, but the question is how it will be conducted. One option is to have a device implanted directly into the brain to stimulate the nerves. I understand that Elon Musk is working on similar technology with his company Neuralink. This technology could have practical applications, not just for video games. Environments, where a person can be physically harmed, can be replaced with this technology. The other option is having a helmet that transmits waves instead of a direct connection. I am not sure of its harmful potential in nature. I doubt it would be a big problem because we are already living in a world full of waves (but then again, those waves are not directly targeting the brain). I need to research more about the physics of waves. So far what I am sure of is that waves operate in a spectrum, a range measured in frequency and length.</li>
                <li>Record Dreams: I realized that I often forget about dreams just ten minutes after waking up. There is technology, being researched in Japan, that is already being developed by using AI to draw whatever image a person is thinking of. However, it is in its early stage and the image can only be done in black and white. This technology could change the environment of artists. If this existed for mass media, a person could just think of what they want instead of hiring a person to draw.</li>
                <li>Audio duplication: I want an AI system to duplicate the way I speak. Why? Just because :). This project is more about understanding AI development fundamentals than worldly achievement.</li>
                <li>Aliens: I want to live long enough to see on the news that another habitable planet has been discovered with life. Fundamentally it makes no sense to me why there wouldn’t be more life in space since it's continuously expanding. I understand that human history is literally nothing compared to how long Earth has existed, but our technology has improved exponentially in a short amount of time. I am hopeful.</li>

                The thing with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that there is a stereotype, 
                almost a misconception, that they are or will be equal to human intelligence. 
                So far, in the current climate, this is wrong. 
                Majority of the use of AI in the tech industry is to enhance an already existing product. 
                It is a tool. 
                You can’t communicate with it unless the entire purpose of the AI was to communicate with a person. 
                As of now, people should understand that AI is a set of instructions with a goal, 
                like all other programs and softwares created from code. 
                “As of now” is stated because only research groups have made progress towards AI becoming more “human.” 
                Of all the AI that exists in the world, most likely 5% at most is geared towards that field. 
                Everything else is to increase the performance of the consumer experience. 
                That being said, the discussion of AI ethics is still relevant for the purpose of 
                being prepared when technology advances enough to create humanlike AI.

                This objective is biology skills and it is about researching organisms and environments. My first sample of work is a list of qualitative and quantitative aspects of my body data collection study. It shows my mastery of this objective because it shows my understanding of research. Finding the qualitative and quantitative parts of research answers why a study is being conducted and acts like a guide to how it will be conducted. My second sample of work is the data that I have collected based on three aspects; what I eat, how active I am, and how much sleep I get daily. This shows my mastery of biology skills because it is an application of the qualitative and quantitative parts of my research.

                There will be two decks of cards. 
                One with the vocab and the other being the "definitions". 
                Each player has 5 definition cards. 
                The game starts with the vocab deck displaying one card at the top. 
                Whoever matches that card with its corresponding definition first, 
                gets to keep the vocab card. 
                Each card won is worth a point. 
                The winner is whoever has the most vocab cards. 
                If you don’t have the right definition, 
                you better start drawing more definition cards!
