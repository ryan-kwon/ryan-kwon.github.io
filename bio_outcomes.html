    Science connections:    I am very interested in artificial intelligence.
                            There is often a talk about ethics and how much of a development of AI
                            will it reach to the point of where they are almost indistinguishable to people.
                            I want to read more into that. 
    Biology concepts:       like a biology book for children, i could have descriptions that point to
                            drawings of different structures. Structures can be anything like skeletal structures
    Biology connections:    I would like to look into diet and exercise (how it works?)
                            so that even I could use the information
    Human concepts:         Cognition and learning. That is a really important concept with AI because
                            it would be a dream for computers to be able to mimic the way humans learn and make connections.
                            Learning how humans learn could give insight into how to create good AI.

            <p>This objective is science concepts and it is about the characteristics and themes of science knowledge. My first sample of work is a plan of how data will be collected for the body data experiment and it shows my mastery of this objective because it demonstrates the understanding of change over time, an important aspect of science and collecting data. My second sample of work is the hypothesis of the body data experiment and this shows mastery of science concepts because hypotheses are like the thesis statement of experiments. It shows how an assumption could be proven correct or incorrect. Change is a big part of science because it has lead to our understanding of the world.</p>

                    <h3>Body Data Plan</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Food consumption: I love food, but this pandemic has truly tested my love for food by seeing it as a hobby I love and eating out of necessity. There have been times where I have gotten either lazy or don’t know what to eat, leading me to make poor food choices</li>
                        <li>Sleep length: For the last two weeks, I have been sleeping later than 1 AM and I just know I am more tired because of it. Maybe this data collection will help me reflect more. This will be measured by hours</li>
                        <li>Amount of exercise: With the weather getting better, I slowly started to go outside and play basketball again. This will be measured by hour(s)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Data will be in numbers for the sleep length and amount of exercise. Food consumption can easily be logged as I type what I eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It would be beneficial if I could break down what I ate so I could log everything in detail and the amount of each food (like cups), if possible. A google spreadsheet should make it easy to log the information. Logging information every day should not be too hard as I could do the sleep length every time I wake up, food consumption during the day, and the amount of exercise at the end of the day.</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Problem:</b> Sleeping late/irregular sleep<br>
                        <b>Variables</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phone time</li>
                        <li>Youtube time</li>
                        <li>Disney+ time</li>
                        <li>Assignments (especially Computer science)</li>
                        <li>Work (I grade worksheets)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Independent variable: phone time | Dependent variable: more sleep time<br>
                        Hypothesis: if the amount of time spend on the phone decreases, then the time sleeping will increase<br>
                        Control group: not caring about how much time I sleep on my phone. Just go with the flow<br>
                        Experimental group: limit time spend on phone to 5 hours a day, then 4, then 3... maybe 0? (this is highly unrealistic)<br>
                        Materials: bed and phone (the phone has the timer already)<br>
                        Type of data: everything will be measured in hours (time spend sleeping). I can get this data by looking at the time right before I sleep and subtracting from the time I wake up. If I wanted anything specific, I could start a timer on my phone right before I sleep<br>
                        Issues: there is a margin of error to consider because people don’t go to sleep right when they close their eyes or right when their alarm goes off.

                This objective is science skills and it is about discovering the natural world. My first sample of work is a bucket list of science-related experiences that I want to have within my lifetime. It shows my mastery of this objective because it sets goals with an understanding of science inherently leading to discovery and ways I could achieve those goals. My second sample of work is my notes from 1A Discovery and Cells. This shows my mastery because notes show the process of formulating an understanding of a topic and can be used again.
            </p>
            <h3>Science Bucket List</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Universe Simulator: I want to create a universe simulator like no other. There are games that exist that let you interact with the solar system or the known universe, however, my creation is different.The simulator will start from the atom and work its way up. This idea stemmed from one of the conversations that I had with a friend about space. I wonder if the universe reset, would that universe look the same as it is now? Will humans look different? Will Earth be the same? This simulation will be able to answer a lot of hypothetical questions in a visual manner. Yes, you will have the option to create your own universe like other games, but the main point of this project is to predict space by manipulating time. Since time travel is not possible, yet, this is a solid substitute.</li>
                <li>Full Immersion Virtual Reality: Virtual reality is a new medium for video games, but it is not widespread yet. Another thing with VR is that you are not able to touch, smell, nor taste. This can be achieved in one of two ways. Both require a connection to the brain, but the question is how it will be conducted. One option is to have a device implanted directly into the brain to stimulate the nerves. I understand that Elon Musk is working on similar technology with his company Neuralink. This technology could have practical applications, not just for video games. Environments, where a person can be physically harmed, can be replaced with this technology. The other option is having a helmet that transmits waves instead of a direct connection. I am not sure of its harmful potential in nature. I doubt it would be a big problem because we are already living in a world full of waves (but then again, those waves are not directly targeting the brain). I need to research more about the physics of waves. So far what I am sure of is that waves operate in a spectrum, a range measured in frequency and length.</li>
                <li>Record Dreams: I realized that I often forget about dreams just ten minutes after waking up. There is technology, being researched in Japan, that is already being developed by using AI to draw whatever image a person is thinking of. However, it is in its early stage and the image can only be done in black and white. This technology could change the environment of artists. If this existed for mass media, a person could just think of what they want instead of hiring a person to draw.</li>
                <li>Audio duplication: I want an AI system to duplicate the way I speak. Why? Just because :). This project is more about understanding AI development fundamentals than worldly achievement.</li>
                <li>Aliens: I want to live long enough to see on the news that another habitable planet has been discovered with life. Fundamentally it makes no sense to me why there wouldn’t be more life in space since it's continuously expanding. I understand that human history is literally nothing compared to how long Earth has existed, but our technology has improved exponentially in a short amount of time. I am hopeful.</li>

            <p>This objective is science connections and it is about society and the scientific enterprise. My first sample of work is a commentary based on reading multiple publications on the ethics of AI  and it shows my mastery of this objective because AI is such a big part of modern technology that a lot of industries are using it. It is important to know how AI creation is conducted for it to be a reliable resource. My second sample of work is a review and credibility review of an article on malaria. This shows my mastery because it is important to stay updated on important scientific discoveries while also understanding the credibility of the source to make sure the article’s points are valid.</p>
            <h3>Ethics of AI</h3>
            <p>The thing with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that there is a stereotype, almost a misconception, that they are or will be equal to human intelligence. So far, in the current climate, this is wrong. Majority of the use of AI in the tech industry is to enhance an already existing product. It is a tool. You can’t communicate with it unless the entire purpose of the AI was to communicate with a person. As of now, people should understand that AI is a set of instructions with a goal, like all other programs and softwares created from code. As of now is stated because only research groups have made progress towards AI becoming more human. Of all the AI that exists in the world, most likely 5% at most is geared towards that field. Everything else is to increase the performance of the consumer experience. That being said, the discussion of AI ethics is still relevant for the purpose of being prepared when technology advances enough to create human-like AI.</p>

                The Francis Crick Institute. "Scientists design new drug compound to stop malaria in its tracks." ScienceDaily. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210512143555.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210512143555.htm</a><br>
                Title: Scientists design new drug compound to stop malaria in its tracks | Date: May 12, 2021 | Publication: Science News<br>
                Topic: How scientists have discovered a way to deal with new malaria strains from mosquitoes<br>
                Criteria: The introduction mentions how infections and dangerous malaria is by stating the yearly deaths and the need for why scientists are even creating new drugs in the first place. The second paragraph states a quote about what malaria parasites are and how they infect people. This makes the article seem credible because it explains the process without complex vocabulary from a credible source, in this case being a researcher from Malaria Biochemistry Laboratory at the Crick. The article is written almost like an abstract of a research article because it states the very important information that the reader really needs. I used multiple websites to fact/bias check the ScienceDaily and from the results, the article seems credible. The article states information directly from the original source, like research facilities. This article specifically cites the research article that readers can access. The dates between the publishing of the research paper and this article is minimal (research: May 18, 2021 & article: May 12, 2021). I would assume the writer of the article got insider news about the research happening which is why it was published before the research paper.

            <p>This objective is biology concepts and it is about describing and explaining life. My first sample of work is a matching game of the digestive system and it shows my mastery of this objective because it is a fun and intuitive way of understanding the organs of the digestive system. My second sample of work is testing the effectiveness between two different mediums in explaining a biology concept, in this case the absorption in the small intestines. This shows mastery in the objective because they explain the structure and function of the small intestines.</p>
            <h3>Matching Game</h3>
            <img class="GIT_image" src="images/png-files/GIT game.png">
            <p>This is a matching game. This is a way for people to give themselves a quick memory test to see if they remember all the parts of a gastrointestinal tract (GIT).</p>

            <h3>Multiple Mediums</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Concept:</b> absorption in small intestines<br>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Effectiveness:</b> Now, considering the effectiveness of both the drawing and poem must be done with a grain of salt, maybe an ocean amount. Initially I will take a drawing/diagram over anything as a way to help with understanding a concept. So as a personal taste, I will state that the drawing is better at conveying information than the poem. However, if a better poem was written than a simple haiku, maybe it would be better with memorization information quickly. I like diagrams better because they are able to show a process and it makes it easier to label things.</p>

                    <b>Week 6 Reflection:</b>
                    Sleep is definitely not going well. I am not exercising as much as I planned (I even stated that going outside would be better than nothing). Food intake has gotten lazy. My focus of this is not to solve all three problems (eating better, exercising more, and getting more sleep). It just seeing better change over time to anything. I will try to commit to 2 hour maximum time spent on my phone to see if that solves anything. This is based on the 5A media.

                    <b>Week 10 Reflection:</b>
                    Amount of sleep has improved and I have done so by reducing my screen time. It would have been a good idea to record data on that too. Nothing else changed much which is disappointing, but I purposefully focused on improving sleep.

            <p>This objective is human concepts and it is about the current understanding about our species. My first sample of work is a card game based on the digestive system. It shows my mastery of this objective because playing this game can be used as an alternative to reviewing and understanding the organs that make up the digestive system. My second sample of work is my first aid training plan. This shows my mastery of this objective because it is a representation of applied understanding of the human cardiovascular system and its disorders.</p>

                    There will be two decks of cards. 
                    One with the vocab and the other being the "definitions". 
                    Each player has 5 definition cards. 
                    The game starts with the vocab deck displaying one card at the top. 
                    Whoever matches that card with its corresponding definition first, 
                    gets to keep the vocab card. 
                    Each card won is worth a point. 
                    The winner is whoever has the most vocab cards. 
                    If you don’t have the right definition, 
                    you better start drawing more definition cards!

                <ol>
                    <li>I chose a training that handles first aid, CPR, and AED.</li>
                    <li>This course was found on this website: <a href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/classes/adult-child-and-baby-first-aid%2Fcpr%2Faed-online/a6R0V0000015EUt.html?cgid=first-aid&isCourse=true&storedistance=undefined#cgid=first-aid&zip=Tigard%2C%2BOR%2C%2BUSA&latitude=45.4186785&longitude=-122.7872475&zipcode=&searchtype=class&start=3">Adult, Child and Baby First Aid/CPR/AED Online (redcross.org)</a>. </li>
                    <li>I chose this course because I don’t know how to handle common medical supplies nor deal with common injuries. At best, I am confident in applying bandages. I believe it would be very useful to knowing how to handle common injuries because they are common. Of course, I highly doubt I would remember most of the information from this course when the knowledge is needed, however, it is probably better to have a higher chance of knowing what to do than doing nothing at all because I don’t know anything.</li>

            <p>This objective is human skills and it is about researching humans. My first sample of work is a safety checklist and it shows my mastery of this objective because conducting research requires preparation to make sure the process goes smoothly. Following the list ensures minimal mistakes to get the result in the most pure form, like only having one independent and dependent variable. My second sample of work is an ethical and biased reflection of the body data collection study. This shows mastery of human skills because research must always follow ethical rules to make sure their data is not being collected unethically and bias must be reduced to get the best results.</p>

            <h3>Bias in Data Collection</h3>
            <p class="" style="float:inline-end">Initially I want to state that there is no possible way of there being bias or unethical behaviors in the data that I collect. After all, it is just a simple collection of how my day went (amount of sleep, exercise, and food). But when recording the amount of sleep or exercise I’ve been getting is often a reality hit and makes me think that this is not enough sleep or exercise I should be getting. I haven’t written any invalid data yet, but I have thought of doing it just for the sake of me having that false satisfaction of a lie. Peer review would always be beneficial for a lot of work, I don’t see where that case would go toward a negative outcome. Peer review is often for improving a draft of work to make sure that the author or the creator of that work is really focusing on their objective.  Benefit from peer review with my body data would be a second verification of the data that I am collecting. Sometimes I forget what food I ate for the day, so I often ask my parents what we had for dinner.</p>

My second sample of work is a story of T cells and it demonstrates my mastery of this objective because it is a narrative story that explains how inflammation works. The goal of the story is to have a different take on the process of immature T cells dealing with pathogens. </p>

The thing that I notice as a sign of growth is the less infant-like face in the second picture. Clothing is less like it was made for a baby but for a young child. The first image has my hands making fists, reflex close to newborns. The hands in the first image are plump, a feature most babies have.</p>

            <h3>Science Story</h3>
            <p>Ezekiel the immature T cell was floating around with his other immature T cell friends. They were vibin. Suddenly, there was an aroma of alerts making other cells around them move in a frenzy. Monocytes were becoming macrophages, helper T cells constantly releasing the alerts, and plasma B cells producing antibodies. The helper T cells told Ezekiel that there was a pathogen that had invaded and that he and his friends must get to work. Luckly, they were a very smart friend group as they learned quickly on how to deal with the pathogen. Sadly some of his friends, Adam and Harry, had to move on and become Memory T cells. They split ways and Ezekiel turned into a cytotoxic T cell. The fight lasted hours, but in the end, Ezekiel and his friends were victorious.</p>
