    Science connections:    I am very interested in artificial intelligence.
                            There is often a talk about ethics and how much of a development of AI
                            will it reach to the point of where they are almost indistinguishable to people.
                            I want to read more into that. 
    Biology concepts:       like a biology book for children, i could have descriptions that point to
                            drawings of different structures. Structures can be anything like skeletal structures
    Biology connections:    I would like to look into diet and exercise (how it works?)
                            so that even I could use the information
    Human concepts:         Cognition and learning. That is a really important concept with AI because
                            it would be a dream for computers to be able to mimic the way humans learn and make connections.
                            Learning how humans learn could give insight into how to create good AI.

                The thing with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that there is a stereotype, 
                almost a misconception, that they are or will be equal to human intelligence. 
                So far, in the current climate, this is wrong. 
                Majority of the use of AI in the tech industry is to enhance an already existing product. 
                It is a tool. 
                You can’t communicate with it unless the entire purpose of the AI was to communicate with a person. 
                As of now, people should understand that AI is a set of instructions with a goal, 
                like all other programs and softwares created from code. 
                “As of now” is stated because only research groups have made progress towards AI becoming more “human.” 
                Of all the AI that exists in the world, most likely 5% at most is geared towards that field. 
                Everything else is to increase the performance of the consumer experience. 
                That being said, the discussion of AI ethics is still relevant for the purpose of 
                being prepared when technology advances enough to create humanlike AI.

                <h3>Week 6 Reflection</h3>
                Sleep is definitly not going well.<br>
                I am not exercising as much as I planned 
                (I even stated that going outside would be better than nothing).
                Food intake has gotten lazy. My focus of this is not to solve all three 
                problems (eating better, exercising more, and more sleep). 
                It just seeing better change over time to anything. 
                I will try to commit to 2 hour maximum time spent on my phone 
                to see if that solves anything. This is based on the 5A media.

                There will be two decks of cards. 
                One with the vocab and the other being the "definitions". 
                Each player has 5 definition cards. 
                The game starts with the vocab deck displaying one card at the top. 
                Whoever matches that card with its corresponding definition first, 
                gets to keep the vocab card. 
                Each card won is worth a point. 
                The winner is whoever has the most vocab cards. 
                If you don’t have the right definition, 
                you better start drawing more definition cards!
