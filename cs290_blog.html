                                I always had issues with the editing of elements clashing with each other.
                                An example of this is with the image of myself.
                                I had a set width in px.
                                I was trying to add a curved border on it, but it was not applying.
                                When inspecting the image, it would show a padding effect.
                                I realized that the image size and the width I set don't not match up well and removed the width.

                                I already knew the basic layout of a webpage and how to stylize them to make the viewing experience better.
                                The html, scss, and javascript tags at the top represent the tools I used to create the webpage.

                                I always use w3schools a lot as a reference point.

                                The main issue I have is the clashing of display flex and width. So far my solution is to not use a width change and use a padding or margin change. So far it works great

                                Positioning elements is something that I had, and still have, a lot of difficulty width. The style display:flex; helps so much with how I understand the way positioning works on elements.

                                The biggest problem I have is not knowing the syntax of JavaScript. I know what I want to do and how to solve the probelms, but not knowing how JS works really hurt.
                                Getting elements from the DOM was kinda challenging because I didn't know how to get the values within the tags properly. JS being a language where the variables are dependent on what
                                you assign them made it all the more confusing when working with comparisons. I had to make sure they were comparing the same types.

                                I learned that JS is confusing. There are many niche ways of doing things that got me lost on what I was originally trying to solve.

                                Holy crap, this is by far the hardest assignment I've delt with. 
                                I get how to create a filter system, but actually implementing it was not good. 
                                If I change one thing, it will mess up another. It's like I created spaghetti code. 
                                I tried multiple different ways of doing it. I thought I finally found a solution, 
                                but it was too late and I had to turn it in. The reoccuring issue I had was the filter 
                                conditions affecting each other to where if one was true, it would override the other 
                                conditions.
